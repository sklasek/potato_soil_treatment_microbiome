**Sequence Data Availability:**    
Raw 16S and ITS amplicon sequence reads associated with this study are publicly available as [NCBI BioProject PRJNA992073](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA992073).  

**Reproducible Workflow:**     
Data analyses associated with this study are available at [this repository](https://github.com/sklasek/potato_soil_treatment_microbiome). For amplicon processing scripts, please see the [page for our Phytobiomes manuscript](https://sklasek.github.io/potato_soil_patterns/). Sequence data were processed in the same way across both studies.
